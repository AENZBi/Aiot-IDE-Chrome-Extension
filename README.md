# AIoT IDE Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension provides a basic integrated development environment (IDE) for AI development and IoT device management, all within your browser.

## Features

* **Code Editor:**
    * Edit code with syntax highlighting (currently basic, will be enhanced).
    * Execute code snippets directly in the extension.
* **AI Integration (Planned):**
    * Integrate with popular AI frameworks (TensorFlow.js, etc.).
    * Create, train, and deploy AI models.
    * Visualize data and model performance.
* **IoT Hub (Planned):**
    * Discover and connect to IoT devices on your network.
    * Monitor device status and control settings.
    * Visualize real-time data streams from sensors.
    * Implement AI-powered analytics for IoT data.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/aenzbi/aiot-ide--chrome-extension.git`
2. **Load the extension in Chrome:**
